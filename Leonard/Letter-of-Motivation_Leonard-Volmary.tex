Sir,\\ %[1em]
%
therewith I apply for your volunteer service in Ghana, Kenia or South Africa in 2015. Preferably I wish to participate in your project 'Street Kids Sport' in Ghana.

More than 20 years ago, my father left Freetown, Sierra Leone, in order to find a better job here in Germany so he could provide for his family back home. Africa and above all West Africa, are my roots and my origin. More than half of my relatives live in Liberia. Until this day, I did not have the opportunity to visit the continent of my own roots and get to know its people as well as their culture. What I have learned so far about Africa's nature, people and music has excited me. I really want to trace back my personal roots and help the people in the place I originally come from. That is the reason, why I wish to do volunteer work in preferably Ghana.

Africa is the continent with the lowest living standard in the world. Disease, violence and poverty are widespread, and we, the rich industrialized nations, also are partly to blame. Educating and supporting children and teenagers are key factors in solving Africa's many problems. I wish to participate in an education project, where the people need help most, but the necessary funds are lacking. Sport is a very suitable way in this regard, so that children and teenagers in difficult situations can play together and have fun through physical exercise. In addition, sport conveys rules and social skills and may be goal and challenges for one's live.

Since the age of five I love playing football in a club and this gives me joy and motivation for my own live. I play football in a higher league in Berlin and I have a profound knowledge of its rules and training methods. I have played other sports like handball, basketball and hockey as well. International football tournements in Spain, Austria and the Netherlands gave me the opportunity to get to know and interact with people from different countries and cultures. 

I was excited by the possibilities sports offer as there are no borders and different people connect with each other. I want to share my knowledge and the satisfaction and joy sport gives me thus helping children and young people. That is why I wish to participate in the project 'Street Kids Ghana'. 

Furthermore I'm interested in learning from my volunteer work and profiting from its experience. I love working with children and since I plan to pursue a career in the sports sector, the service will give me valuable experiences for my future. Moreover I wish to learn from the people in Africa in how they live and perceive sport in addition to how they cope with their daily lives that are so different from ours. The volunteer service also gives me the opportunity to get to know my West African roots. Above all, I want to play a part in helping people, children and teenagers, in West Africa to enjoy live and learn through sport. 

  
Yours sincerely,\\[2em] % if the opening is "Dear Mr(s) Doe,"
